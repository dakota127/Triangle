# Led Triangle
Built after Micah Elizabeth Scott's Triangle Attractor
http://www.misc.name/#/triangle-attractor/

This Triangle can connect to two different control boxes:

a) Simple control box (containing one Fadecandy board) with USB connection to laptop running Processing scripts.
b) Stand-alone Raspberry Control Box runs Python scripts. 433 Mhz remote control to change lightpattern, brightness and speed. Photoresistor on top of Control Box for automatic brightness adjustment.
Sharp distance sensor in base for additional pattern control.
Interface Board uses my iSwitchPi - Intelligent Power Switch for Raspberry PI. One button power On/Off.
Raspi box plays 15 different lightpatterns.
